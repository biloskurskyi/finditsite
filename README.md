FindIt: Your Personal Photo Recognition Tool  
Greetings! Welcome to FindIt â€“ my inaugural pet project developed on Django and powered by TensorFlow.  
   
FindIt is a web application designed to recognize parts of photos using advanced 2D models.    
It offers three distinct modes of recognition: Common Pixels, Isolation, and Detection & Highlight.   
   
Common Pixels: This feature, prominently displayed on the site, identifies original 2D pictures within    
another photo by analyzing common pixels. The backend logic for this function is encapsulated in file 1_better.py.   
   
Isolation: In this category, users can upload a picture containing a 2D model,   
and the program will isolate other objects in the image, presenting the user's photo in a 3D space.     
This function draws parallels to similar features found in iPhone AI, where it intelligently identifies persons or objects.   
   
Detection & Highlight: The final feature enhances object identification by outlining them in various colors,   
offering a clear visual representation of recognized items.   
   
To utilize the app, users are required to register and log in to their accounts.
